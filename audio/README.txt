Background music for the portfolio

Place your audio file here as:

  ambient.mp3

The play/pause control (♪) in the bottom-left of the page will use this file.
Use a calm, loop-friendly track (e.g. lo-fi, ambient) to match the site's tone.

If the file is missing, the control hides itself automatically.
